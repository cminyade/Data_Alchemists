# 🎬 Contribution Guidelines – Film Classification Project
Thank you for your interest in contributing to the KFCB Film Classification using NLP & ML project! We welcome contributions that improve the model, enhance fairness, or expand the system's capabilities.

## 🚀 How to Contribute
1. Fork this repository and clone it to your machine.

2. Create a new branch for your update:

bash
 git checkout -b feature/my-feature
 
 3. Make your changes:

* Add new models, preprocessing techniques, or evaluation methods.

* Improve the dashboard or API.

* Enhance the documentation or add test cases.

4. Commit with a clear message:

bash

git commit -m "Add: short description of contribution"

5. Push to your fork and submit a Pull Request.

## 🧠 What You Can Contribute
* 🧹 Preprocessing: Cleaner pipelines, better handling of noise/imbalance.

* 🤖 Modeling: Experiment with new classifiers (e.g., BERT, RoBERTa).

* 📈 Evaluation: Confusion matrix analysis, fairness metrics.

* 🌐 Deployment: API improvements, Streamlit enhancements.

* 📝 Docs: Tutorials, walkthroughs, or usage instructions.

## ⚙️ Best Practices
* Follow Pythonic conventions and use clear, descriptive names.

* Keep code modular and well-documented.

* Use relative paths; no hardcoded directories.

* Ensure reproducibility – all notebooks/scripts should run end-to-end.

## 🧪 Testing & Fairness
* Evaluate changes using metrics like Accuracy, F1-score, Recall.

* Check confusion matrix especially for minority classes (e.g., "R", "18").

* Consider bias mitigation (SMOTE, class weighting) if applicable.
